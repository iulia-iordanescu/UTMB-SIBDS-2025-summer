INTRODUCTION
• The anti-hyperglycemic sodium glucose co-transporter-2
inhibitors (SGLT-2i), a class of medications initially made
to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are now
approved for heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) regardless of T2DM status


• SGLT-2i are usually not administered in the hospital
setting due to the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)


SPECIFIC AIM
• Determine whether continued in hospital use of SGLT-2i
is associated with an increased risk of DKA, extended
hospital length of stay (LOS), and increased 30-day
inpatient readmission rates


HYPOTHESIS
• We hypothesize that continuation of SGLT-2i in the
hospital is not associated with increased rates of DKA,
increased 30-day inpatient readmission rates, and
increased LOS as compared to discontinuation of SGLT-2i
in hospital




METHODS
• We accessed TriNetX, a large national database with
information on diagnoses and drug exposures for
hospital visits, from which we made our cohort


• We indexed the 148,807,502 hospital visits for patients
with at least two SGLT-2i prescriptions in 2022 that
had an inpatient visit 30 days after the start of at least
one of those prescriptions, and kept all visits for each
such patient. Of these visits, we then kept only those
that were inpatient, with LOS>=2 days, aged >= 18
years old at time of visit, and with at least one SGLT-2i
prescription for 30 consecutive days before the visit


• The outcomes of interest for each visit are development
of DKA, 30-day inpatient readmission, and LOS


• To account for visit and location clustering, mixed
effects models were used


• For 30-day inpatient readmission: mixed effects logistic
regression


• For LOS: mixed effects linear model with a log
transformation on the LOS






  



DISCUSSION
• SGLT-2i were continued only in 266 visits (12%) during
hospitalization


• There were only 12 visits (0.5%) where DKA was documented


• All cases of DKA occurred in patients who were not on SGLT-2i
during their hospital stay




CONCLUSIONS
• The number of cases with continued SGLT-2i use in the hospital in
this cohort is small and reflects current practice.


• We are unable to determine whether SGLT-2i use in the hospital is
associated with increased DKA rates as compared to discontinued as a
result of small cohort size and small number of DKA developments.


• We did not find a significant association between readmission rate and
in hospital use of SGLT-2i. The confidence interval (0.845, 1.775) is
wide likely due to small cohort size


• We did not find a significant association between LOS and in hospital
use of SGLT-2i. The confidence interval (0.939,1.165) is wide likely
due to small cohort size




NEXT STEPS
• Expand TriNetX cohort beyond one calendar year to increase number
of eligible visits.


• Consider less restrictive eligibility criteria, such as in number of
prescriptions filled prior to admission.


• Euglycemic DKA and medication-induced ketoacidosis may not be
identified with ICD codes for DKA. Using diagnostic laboratory results
available in the database may uncover missed cases.


• Further understanding of the cases of DKA observed in this cohort
may identify modifiable factors that will decrease the risk of DKA
among SGLT-2i users
